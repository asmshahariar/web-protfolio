        <h3>World-class web dev </h3>
        <p>Web developers design and create websites. They are         responsible for the look of the site. They are also responsible for the site's technical aspects, such as its performance and capacity, which are measures of a website's speed and how much traffic the site can handle.</p>

            <h3>Become World's no.1 developer</h3>
            <p>It all starts with a dream. Taken from Roy Bennett’s The Light in the Heart, this line reminds us that every successful person first discovers their dream before taking action. Once we have a clear idea of what we want, we can create goals to accomplish it.</p>
